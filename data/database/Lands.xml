		<name>Hegos Plains</name>
		<description>Hegos Plains, named after famous advocate of terraforming - Arthur Hegos, were the first regions to be discovered. In these areas no bigger terrain diversity is to be found. The height amplitude is relatively narrow resulting in almost flat areas. On plains many herbs may be found, but only wise mind will appreciate and make use of them. Hegos Plains are home to many animals. Some of them are dangerous but in many cases its better to run away or hide.
		
		The climate here is bearable for humans, even without a special suit. During spring the temperature shifts from 7 degrees Celcius to 18. Summertime is much more pleasant for most people, reaching temperatures between 15 and 36 degrees Celcius. When over half of year is past, outdoor condition start to become less friendly. Rain is more common sight and it's generally colder reaching between 2 and 8 degrees Celcius. Near the year's end winter brings the lowest temperatures you can experience here. They drop even to -18 degrees Celcius, and at best conditions temperatures reach up to -3 degrees Celcius.</description>
